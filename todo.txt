[] Organizing shaders: Skybox, instancing, PBR, animated, shaders folder, /Ishaders\ compiler flag.

[] Figure out a neat way to serialize stuff.
[] Modify mesh exporter: 
	Always export face info. Averaging takes place in mesh load time.
	Export flags variable for things like (is_smooth_shaded, uses_height_map, and such).
	Better hashing.
	Make the exporters as blender addons for convenience.
[] Modify mesh.h/cpp to average TBNs based on exported flags.

[] Add support for heightmaps/bumpmaps.
[] Forward+ shading.

[] orh_collision.h: GJK.

[] Fix visual bug: For some reason, when using when using 4x MSAA, rasterizer is causing seams when triangles meet.

[] Do proper blending between animations. Reference casey's video: (neighborhood vs. invert vs. direct).
